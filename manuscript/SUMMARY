Palaeontological information can be used to reconstruct 'family trees' using one of two methods: step-counting parsimony or model-based probabilistic approaches.
The probabilistic approach is often more accurate, but less precise.
Here I show that the parsimony approach is no less instructive than probabilistic methods, and is able to achieve the same accuracy if some of its innate precision is shed.
This has implications for how evolutionary history should be reconstructed from the fossil record.
